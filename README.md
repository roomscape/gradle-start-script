This reproduces an issue with the Unix startup script generated by the Gradle `application` plugin.

Build the application with Docker:

```
docker build -t example .
docker run --env JAVA_OPTS="-Dfoo=bar" example
```

# Expected behaviour
The application prints the following:
```
Application was started with -Dfoo=bar
```

# Actual behaviour:
The application prints the following:
```
/example/bin/example: line 233: xargs: command not found
Application was started with -Dfoo=null
```
